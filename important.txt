9) Relationship between Node and Express.
================================================================================

Q) How to start the project?
    Use the command `npm init`. 
    To install express type `npm install --save express`

Q) What is node?
    Its a javascript runtime used to execute code outside of the browser.

Q) What is express?
    Library that runs in the Node runtime. Has helpers to make dealing with HTTP
    traffice easier.

Q) Explain the relation between node and express?
    Node listens on some port to receive all incoming HTTP requests on that port.
    Whenever a request is received by node, it hands off that request to Express.
    
    Express will look at the request, and decides which route handler to use.
    The response from route handler is handed over to Node, and node hands off
    the response to a client who had originally requested.
    
    For diagram, see the Book Notes.

Q) What is index.js file?
    Traditionally, starting point of a node project is index.js file.
    You can use any file name for starting point of node project. But tradition-
    ally it is index.js file.

Q) Module system in express?
    Node at this point supports COMMONJS type of module system.
    Module system is used to import or make use of already existing code.
    Your code is divided up into multiple files, and you can import those files
    as you see fit.
    
    For server side we make use of COMMONJS type of module system.
    For React we make use of ES2015 type of module system.
    
Q) How to use route handlers in Express?
    By using app.get('/') syntax, we can create route handlers.
    For C9, try running it on port 8080 instead of 5000.
